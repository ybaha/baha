## Discovering the "is" Keyword in TypeScript

I’ve been using TypeScript for a while now, but I never needed the `is` keyword—until recently. In a project, I had to handle different object types in a single function. TypeScript couldn’t figure out the types on its own, so I finally learned about user-defined type guards.

Here’s what I found:  

### What’s the `is` Keyword?  

The `is` keyword is used in type guard functions to narrow down types. For example:

```typescript
function isCat(animal: Cat | Dog): animal is Cat {
  return (animal as Cat).meow !== undefined;
}
```

This checks if the `animal` has a `meow` method. Inside the `if` block, TypeScript treats `animal` as a `Cat`. No more type confusion.

### Why It’s Useful  

- Handles complex union types easily.  
- Ensures type safety while simplifying your code.  

Honestly, it’s one of those features you don’t think about until you need it.

Here's the official documentation for it: <Link href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates">TypeScript Handbook</Link>
