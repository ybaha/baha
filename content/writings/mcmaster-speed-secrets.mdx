## McMaster-Carr: The Website That Pretends Not to Care About Speed

<Link href="https://www.mcmaster.com">McMaster-Carr</Link>’s website feels like a time capsule from the early web. But here’s the trick: that “we don’t care about speed” look? It’s a calculated move. Beneath the dated design are clever optimizations that make it faster than most modern websites.

### Tricks They Don’t Talk About 🕵️‍♂️

#### 1. **Server Rendering**  
Everything is served as plain HTML, straight from the server. It’s simple, reliable, and fast.

#### 2. **Link Prefetching**  
Hover over a link, and the site quietly preloads the next page. By the time you click, it’s already there. You barely notice it, and that’s the point.

#### 3. **Caching Like a Pro**  
The site aggressively caches content and uses CDNs to deliver it quickly. They won’t tell you this, but it’s why everything feels instant.

#### 4. **Image Sprites**  
Instead of loading multiple images, they bundle them into one sprite file. Fewer requests, faster loading.

#### 5. **Critical CSS**  
Key styles are loaded inline to avoid delays, giving the illusion of a fully loaded page even before it’s finished.

#### 6. **Selective JavaScript**  
Only the bare minimum JavaScript is loaded. No unnecessary clutter.

### What We Can Learn  

1. **Simplicity Wins**  
   The fastest websites aren’t necessarily the flashiest.

2. **Old Tech Can Shine**  
   Optimized legacy systems can outperform modern frameworks.

3. **Users Want Speed**  
   A functional, fast site beats a fancy, slow one.

McMaster-Carr plays it cool, but their performance game is sharp. They’ve nailed the art of pretending not to care while obsessing over the details. Respect.
